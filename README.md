Strata

Strata encompasses and fully centers itself around sophisticated architectural ideas such as DDD (domain-driven design), CQRS, event sourcing.

From a more technical standpoint, Strata's "opinions" include:
- NATS as the connective backbone â€” middleware used for asynchronous messaging, synchronous (blocking) request-reply, distributed locking, and configuration management.
- MongoDB as the source-of-truth event store.
- Elasticsearch as the query engine.
